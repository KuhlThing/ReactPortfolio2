## Portfolio app built with React and Material-UI  

I followed a tutorial from [80/20 Coding on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCobZg0ym72ZZPqOQNB_qJnw)  

The deployed version on [Heroku](https://pm-react-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) doesn't work for reasons I can't figure out. I get a 503 error that references favicon.ico, and the internet has offered hundreds of solutions that don't work.
